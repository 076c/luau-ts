# Luau TS

# What is this?
This module provides a standard Luau Abstract Syntax Tree in TypeScript. It is designed to be used as a transpiler

# What languages can be transpiled?
Rust (which is my main priority) is the **only** transpileable language so far.

# How do I use this?
To use this, run (with node) `node main.js`.
- -i determines the input file (e.g -i testing.rs)
- -o determines the output for this file (e.g -o output.luau)
- -n determines if the application runs in interactive mode (capture input until force end)
